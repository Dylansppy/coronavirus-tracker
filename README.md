# Novel Coronavirus Tracker
Interactive map plotting the spread of novel coronavirus. Provides a time-series view of the spread of novel coronavirus across the globe. Along with statistics plotted down to the county-level, a running worldwide total is present, including mortality statistics.

An interactive .html is available in the repo, as well as the accompanying Jupyter Notebook in which the data was processed to produce the map.

To download and view the .html file, first click on the .html file in the repository. Then, click on "View raw", which should present you with a large amount of indecipherable HTML and Javascript code. Right click -> Save as... to an appropriate location on your computer. Then, simply open the .html file (it should automatically open in your default browser) and interact with the chart using the slider at the bottom.
